# AvroCppGoReact

Small group of apps where they talk with Apache Avro:
    * C++ app working as core backend, creating some serious data
    * Go app working as web backend, receives the info from C++ side
    * React on front to show up the dummy data


## DISCLAIMER

This is absolutely not the best or even feasible way to work with Avro, I'm just killing some time doing stupid things. It very well might not be even useful. However you can read it, if you really wanted to!
